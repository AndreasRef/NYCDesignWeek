Project name: Day & Night

48 custom made LED tubes, four Kinect depth cameras, 24 vibration sensors, three laptops running custom Processing scripts that trigger our hardware via Resolume Arena. All sounds are made in Ableton live using costume made Max4Live patches. 


How does it work?
The positions of the audience is tracked using depth cameras, and is converted into positions in a grid. This grid acts as a musical sequencer where notes and lights are synced and triggered according to the position and number of audience. Additionally the inner tubes have built in vibration sensors, that react with light animations and sound when hit by the audience.
